# AI-Generated Data Roadmap
## Extracted from Follow-Up Questions During Buyer Testing

**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Source:** Follow-up questions generated by GPT-5 during failed/partial buyer persona queries  
**Purpose:** The AI's follow-up questions reveal exactly what data structure and metadata buyers need

---

## Key Insight

When the AI cannot answer a buyer query due to missing data, it generates **exceptionally intelligent follow-up questions** that reveal:
1. What data fields are missing
2. What relationships need to exist
3. What metadata would make queries answerable
4. What granularity buyers actually need

**These follow-up questions are essentially writing our data schema specification for us.**

## Time-Series Data Needed

The follow-up questions consistently ask for **temporal analysis**:

- "Year-over-year growth"
- "Recent deals (last 12-18 months)"
- "2024 vs 2023 comparison"

**Implication:** Every major entity needs **timestamped records** to enable trend analysis.

## Conclusion

The AI's follow-up questions are **exceptionally valuable** because they:

1. **Identify exact data gaps** - What's missing from database
2. **Reveal buyer priorities** - What information matters most
3. **Suggest data structure** - How to organize information
4. **Define granularity** - Level of detail needed
5. **Map relationships** - How entities connect
6. **Specify sources** - Where to find missing data

**Recommendation:** After completing all 100 buyer persona queries, compile all follow-up questions and use them as the **definitive data expansion roadmap**. The AI is essentially writing our product requirements document through its questions.
